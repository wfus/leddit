I hung out at my friend\u2019s apartment for three hours and in that time I had one vodka shot and two beers. I\u2019m 26M, 6\u20191\u201d, 210lbs, it takes a lot more than that.\n\nSo when I got up to leave, a girl at the party told me I should call an Uber because she saw me drinking. This girl is my friend\u2019s coworker\u2019s girlfriend and this was my first time meeting her. I told her thanks for the concern but I\u2019m fine to drive. She said that her little brother died from a drunk driver so it made her really uncomfortable that I was driving after drinking. I said that two beers wasn\u2019t drinking. She said that I had a vodka shot as well. I said that was two hours ago. She said still I shouldn\u2019t drive myself. I said I had to be up for work so I didn\u2019t have time to have this argument, and I left.\n\nApparently she complained about me being irresponsible and disrespectful for the rest of the night, according to another friend who was there and kept texting me about it. This other friend told me I should\u2019ve just taken an Uber because she kept talking about her dead brother and bumming everyone out. I texted \u201cWhy do I have to take an Uber, she\u2019s the one with the issue\u201d and my friend texted back \u201cDon\u2019t be such a dick, her brother died.\u201d I texted back \u201cWhen? Last week?\u201d and my friend just said \u201cMan you\u2019re SUCH a dick\u201d. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He\u2019s a fairly close friend. We have seen each other about 2-3 times a year since we were 10. He got married to his longtime girlfriend who we have met a handful of times. \n\nHe is now a lawyer his wife in med school and their parents are all dentists and pharmacists and doctors etc. To call this wedding extravagant is like calling the Mona Lisa a nice drawing. We added up the things we knew the cost of and got to 100,000USD and there were lots of things we didn\u2019t know the cost of. If you told me they spent half a million I would believe you. There were approx. 400 people at the event. \n\nThe wedding was very nice. Big church big dress teams of photographers and videographers. Dinner was crazy huge and very fancy.\n\nThey had hired a band as well as two dj\u2019s. In front of this large sound setup were 5 iPads where you could request music. My wife and I go to the machines and start browsing. Well I found the song Bloodletting by Burn the Priest (if you don\u2019t know it go check it out it will provide some context) so I click on it and it sends it off. I figured if it was in there maybe there were some other metal fans there or at the very least that the DJ sees the requests and makes decisions. Honestly I didn\u2019t think much past \u201coh cool man\u201d and smashed the screen (it was open bar obviously). \n\nAbout half an hour later the song comes on. Those of you who know the song or went to check it out know how it\u2019s extremely intense right from the start. My wife and I are like \u201cfuck ya!\u201d and run to the dance floor. After a few minutes of head banging and body checking my wife I look up to see we\u2019re the only ones on the dance floor and the bride is yelling at the DJ. \n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for everyone to figure out what just happened so her anger turns to us. Guys she fucking lost it. We ruined her wedding, we\u2019re terrible people, something about satan at a godly event. I wish I could remember more of what she said cause it was amazing. She storms off brides maids in tow. I find my friend (the groom) to try and smooth things over. He\u2019s not mad at all he thought is was hilarious and was about to grab his groomsmen and join us but his wife stopped him. I apologized for causing what was probably their first fight as a married couple and ask if he can use his lawyer skills to help me get back on his wife\u2019s good side. He says he\u2019s not that good a lawyer lol. We make a few more jokes and he leaves to go check on his wife. We head home soon after since we seem to be getting a lot of odd looks. \n\nThe day after the wedding I start feeling bad about it. With the alcohol cloud now gone I feel like maybe I was TA for picking such an intense song at an event that probably wasn\u2019t appropriate for it. But on the other hand if you\u2019re going to allow guests to pick songs there\u2019s a good chance someone will pick something you don\u2019t like.\n\nThis has been bugging me for days so reddit AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

When I took over, some people weren\u2019t too happy about it, and they\u2019ve been trying like hell to push me out.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s basically been a witch hunt from day one\u2014with our internal investigations board launching attack after attack. Meanwhile, I\u2019ve had a revolving door with my close staff. (You would not *believe* how hard it\u2019s been to find a communications director.)\u00a0\n\nNaturally, I started insisting that each and every one of my employees swear an oath of unending, unconditional loyalty to me. How else can I be sure they\u2019re not planning a coup?\u00a0\n\nMost people have had no problem with this. In fact, many haven\u2019t hesitated to throw their friends and even their family under the bus for me. But there\u2019s this one guy (let\u2019s call him \u201cJim\u201d) who totally refused.\u00a0\n\nI had nothing against Jim when I started. In fact, I liked him. While I was vying for my current position, he shared some information about my rival that helped me get the job. But since I\u2019ve taken over, our relationship has changed dramatically.\n\nTo make matters worse, he\u2019s the director of our investigations board. As I\u2019ve already mentioned, they\u2019ve been in a thorn in my side (or should I say \u201ca spur in my heel\u201d?) since I took over. They\u2019ve accused me of misconduct, investigated my relationships with other corporate leaders, and they keep throwing around the words \u201chigh crimes.\u201d\u00a0\n\nTo be clear: Everything they\u2019ve accused me of is true. Which is why it was so important to me that Jim promise to drop all ongoing and future investigations and pledge his allegiance to me over and above all others\u2014including but not limited to his parents, his wife and his first-born son.\u00a0\n\nWhen he refused to comply with this totally normal and completely legal request, I had no choice but to fire him. But now everybody\u2019s up in arms and acting like I\u2019m the jerk\u2014when really, he\u2019s the one who started it.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Something to note about my Mother is that she is an over sharer. As in will tell your private medical information to the grocery store cashier over sharer. So when I told my parents about being trans I specified to both of them that it wasn't safe for them to share this information with people and that it was something that I needed to do myself. My mom just looked at me confused so my dad clarified to her that she wasn't allowed to say anything about it to anyone. She got super offended and said that she wasn't going to say anything to anyone.\n\nCut to a few weeks ago and I attempted to come out to my sister. Only to find out that my mom had outed me to her and had been texting her very hurtful things about me and my transition, and had been doing so within days of my visit. I know for a fact that if she's outed me to one person there's definitely more. So I made the decision that my mother no longer gets information about me unless it's public knowledge. My Dad supports me in this but my siblings think that I'm being unreasonable and that it's just how my mom is and I need to just grow up and get over it. \n\nSo Reddit AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

(im in high school btw) I asked who\u2019s dog is that and the girl\nnext to me said it was hers and i asked her to move it. She put the decently sized dog in a tote and i saw an immense amount of  dog hair on my desk. i am irritated at this point because i DO NOT want to be covered in dog hair and the dog smells like shit. when the teacher came in he asked her to put the dog away and he went to his desk and made a phone call to the office and they said they would send someone up, but that someone never came. at this point me and the other kid next to me (theres three desks lined up im in the middle desk, dog girl is to my left and the other kid is to my right) are both irritated and kind of talking shit. I started texting my mom about the matter and the text said this:\n\n\u201cthis girl brought a DOG to school and it smells SO BAD and theres dog hair all over me bc she let it on my desk and the teacher is doing absolutely nothing abt this dog. can you email the principal\u201d\n\nand after i hit send i hear the girl say \u201cwhat? email the principal???\u201d  and i turn around and ask her whats wrong with her and why she read my text. She said i shouldn\u2019t have been talking about her and i said \u201cwell you shouldn\u2019t have brought a dog to school. thats so inconsiderate. what if someone was allergic ? what if it has to use the bathroom? not only is it inconsiderate to other people but its inconsiderate to the dog as well. i wouldn\u2019t wanna be a big dog in a bag all day. theres a time and a place for a dog and school os not one of them. if we have uniforms because regular day clothes are too distracting then what\u2019s a dog?\u201d and she had nothing to say to that. A few minutes later she got up and asked if she could go in the hallway. She ended up going home and my teacher stood outside the whole class waiting her her to come back.  \nThen, a girl who sat a few rows in front of me turned around and said \u201cwhats YOUR problem with the dog\u201d and i pretty much repeated the exact same thing to her to which she replied \u201cwell shed probably take car of a problem\u201d and i said \u201cyou cant take care of an allergic reaction\u201d and the kid next to me stepped in and stopped the interaction.  After talking to my teacher at lunch i found out that he got in trouble for it and the girl went home for the day because i apparently made her su*c*dal (her words) by making that comment. \n\nso, reddit, AITA bc i kinda feel like a Karen.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

We started dating when we were 25 and 23, respectively. He had just finished Law School and I had just finished my MSc. I was only my way to med school, which is 4 years. My husband wanted to have kids early, as he is really likes kids (as do I). He and I decided that we both would rotate time of work to care for the kids. He also was concerned about declining fertility and increased potential of disabled kids. However, I wanted to finish my med school first. \n\nWhen I graduated, I told my husband that I wanted to get started on residency before we have kids. This way I have some work experiences. I've done almost a year now, but I decided that I wanted to get going a few more years of medical training. I really don't want to deal with pregnancy and breastfeeding right now. At the end of the day, I do want to be able to spend time with my infants, but I rather get established career wise first, which will take around 4 more years. My husband thinks that that would be going on too long and that we have waited enough.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It was a tough choice, but because of some personal circumstances, we really wanted a boy. The fetus was female, so we chose to abort. My MIL didn\u2019t know the reasons behind the abortion (we told her \u201cit wasn\u2019t meant to be\u201d), but she is prone to telling stories, and apparently she\u2019s told some friends and extended family that our fetus had a life-altering defect and wouldn\u2019t have lived long. \n\nFast forward to last night. My MIL, SIL, and a female cousin were drinking together at my MIL/ FIL\u2019s house. My cousin started talking about her friend, who is pregnant. The fetus has some serious abnormalities, and the friend is considering a termination. My MIL suggested that I talk to the friend, given my \u201csimilar experience.\u201d \n\nI asked what she meant, and that\u2019s when I found out she\u2019s been telling people that my pregnancy was \u201cincompatible with life.\u201d I told her I\u2019d never said that, and that the real reason we aborted was gender. \n\nShe got really quiet, and she later sent my husband a sad text about how bummed she is we couldn\u2019t \u201cget over\u201d the fetus\u2019 sex.\n\nNow I feel like an asshole for telling her the truth.

I eventually started to not feel too great eating fully vegan so have recently started eating fish 2-3 times a week and am feeling a lot better. \n\nI haven\u2019t told any of my family or friends yet for 2 reasons. 1 is I feel a lot of shame at eating animals when I hate the idea of it and wish I didn\u2019t have to, and  secondly because is nearly all other ways I still consider myself vegan, I don\u2019t eat any other meat, eggs, dairy, I don\u2019t wear leather, I make sure all my toiletries/household items are vegan and cruelty free, it\u2019s simply a lot easier to just say I\u2019m vegan than to explain that I\u2019m mostly vegan but not quite. \n\nMy sister called in yesterday and saw an empty packet of salmon on my worktop so she obviously started asking question. She had quite an extreme reaction and called me a fraud and a hypocrite (for the record I never have and never will put anyone down for eating meat) and she said it\u2019s wrong of me to allow everyone to continue thinking I\u2019m vegan when I\u2019m not as people put in extra effort to cater for me etc. \n\nI don\u2019t really see how this is true as 90% (probably more) of the time I still eat plant-based anyway, and when it comes to people catering for me it seems simpler to just still say I\u2019m vegan as thats easy for people to understand. \n\nAITA here for not telling everyone I\u2019m now eating fish a few time\u2019s a week. (I should also add I haven\u2019t lied to anyone about this, I just haven\u2019t made the point of telling everyone about it).\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

So I'm 21F whose parents got divorced about 6 yrs ago, once mom found out dad's either gay or bi and having an affair with a man. Nowadays dad's married to the same man, while mom still hates his guts and expects us (my brother and I) to despise him all the same. The thing is we've grown since the initial anger and learned how to cope, manage our emotions and forgive, but she hasn't.\n\nWe constantly fight with mom whenever dad wants us to spend time together because she sees it as betrayal, although my brother and I are both adults making our own decision at this point.\n\nSo my dad and his husband invited me and brother to a trip across Germany this summer. My brother can't go because of an internship, but I'd love to join them. This might be my only chance to visit the country in a long time. However when my mom found out about the trip, she launched into a text rant (followed by multiple calls) about how I support adultery and the pain dad has caused if I accept to go on the trip.\n\nIMHO. My mom's living in the past and refusing to move on. I'll never deny that dad cheated but if I lived the rest of my life holding a grudge, where would that miserable existence bring me?\n\nIn your objective opinion though, AITA if I accept to go on this vacation? Maybe I'm missing something in the story, I don't know.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My fiance is okay with it but it weirds me out.\n\nA couple of years ago, me (M22) and my fiance (M44) decided to let his nephew (M21) move across the country to stay with us so he could figure out his life. During his time with us, he met a girl and they quickly became serious. He was an okay roommate, but between his jobs, meeting with his recruiter to join the military, and spending time with his girlfriend, he didn't really spend a lot of quality time with me or my fiance. Other than being roommates, we didn't really see much of him. We saw even less of him when he moved out on his own for a brief period, and we didn't really see him unless he needed something from us. Eventually, he joined the military and went off to boot camp.\n\nNow, he's officially finished all of his training and is taking leave before heading off to his first duty station. He called my fiance and asked if he could crash at our place so he could see his girlfriend before shipping off across the country. His girlfriend is currently in college and is dorming, so he can't stay with her. My fiance doesn't care, because he sees it as helping out family, and it's not a huge disturbance in our day-to-day living. However, it feels a little weird to me because we all know that his nephew is not coming to visit us at all, but he would basically be using our house as a place to spend \"quality time\" with his girlfriend for about a week. This is compounded by the fact that even though his nephew spent a year living with us, we know that if he wasn't dating his girlfriend, he wouldn't think twice about coming to visit us during his leave. I told my fiance that if he is coming to visit us, he can stay with us; but if he's coming to visit his girlfriend, he should go ahead and find other rooming arrangements. However, my fiance still asserts that it's not a huge sacrifice to us, so we should let him stay.\n\nAITA for not wanting his nephew to turn our house into pound town? Granted, they're pretty quiet when they're over and they don't really disturb us, but this feels more like a principles thing.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I simply said the OP was also an asshole for saying that books are worth more than a (possibly deep) friendship. Like most everyone in this sub, the arguments you set forth are focusing on the negatives of the other person to justify the negatives of OP. I am simply saying that OP isn\u2019t 100% free of wrongdoing. \n\nMy calling out OP does not minimize how utterly shitty OP\u2019s friend was. It sounds like there may be an assumption that I was suggesting that. Also, the friend being arguably more of an asshole than OP doesn\u2019t change that OP was also an asshole (even if to less of an extent).\n\nIf I recall correctly, the about section of r/AITA even states that most situations will result in the ESH classification. This post is no different. Unfortunately, most humans, like myself, are flawed and can\u2019t see themselves in a negative light. They will often say: well shit, that\u2019s how I would have reacted. How could I possibly be an asshole?",

My main concern is my best friend is in her early 30s, this guy is on the cusp of divorce, he's about 30+ years older, and she just joined a secret society (think Freemasons) that he's apart of right before he decided to try and make their relationship romantic. \n\nHere's the timeline:\n\nAbout 6 months ago, my friend tells me she's looking into joining a secret society she's been studying. She's really into metaphysics and stuff like that--I don't judge. I joined a sorority in college, so I see the appeal. No biggie. She tells me she's met this guy who is teaching a class she's been taking in her spare time, and tells me that she's been asking him questions about it because he's joined up with this group. I don't think much of it.\n\nOver 6 months, she forms a pretty tight friendship with this guy. I ask if I can meet him at some point and she adamantly states she'll try to set something up so I can put a face to the guy she's so taken with. Plans never get made. I'm a little bit wary now because she's dodging the event, but I don't hound her about it. People get busy, so I just assume I'll meet him eventually.\n\nA few weeks ago, she tells me she's going out of state to some location where they perform initiation. I'm worried about it and I try to ensure she updates me on her location regularly, and check to be sure she at least told other people she's going out of town too even if she didn't state the reason. My main concern is she's traveling with this dude I've yet to meet in person. All I know about him is he's into metaphysics, he is going through a messy divorce, and he works in the science field.\n\nShe comes back and tells me she had a great time and the experience was amazing. Time passes, I'm less suspicious--until last night when she told me this guy's 30 years her senior, he's signing divorce papers soon, and he's asked her to go on a date with him once his divorce is finalized.\n\nShe thinks I'm judging him too harshly, but I HAVEN'T MET THE GUY. I can only judge based on what she's told me. I said that the only way I'd back off this stance is if I got to meet him in person and judge his character myself.\n\nSo, AITA in this situation?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He\u2019s a good kid and a really nice friend to have however he is just off in many ways. He doesn\u2019t really pay attention, he doesn\u2019t listen, and he has a bit of an anger problem. I asked him about it and he said he had ADHD and another thing he couldn\u2019t remember.\n\nSo I have him in gym class and he\u2018s not the strongest kid, and arguably one of the weaker ones. So he\u2019s often at the bottom of competitions and he\u2019s often angry. Because I\u2019m his partner often it\u2019s kinda embarrassing that every time he fails a basket or misses a volleyball he stomps his feet and punches a wall. I wanted to help him so I talked with him. However today I just lost it. I told him you can\u2019t act like this in public and if you do you\u2019ll be immediately fired. Also I told him life isn\u2019t fair and you can\u2019t do anything about it; just adapt to it. You can\u2018t change anything about it. No one will go easy on you.\n\nI felt bad so after I cooled off I told him I was sorry for yelling at him however what I said was true; you can\u2019t do this.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
