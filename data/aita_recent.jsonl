It\u2019s normal stuff, it happens and 2. It\u2019s not constant for either of us so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n   She also had an issue with me seeing my girlfriend every now and then whenever I have time, saying that I don\u2019t make time for her and that I don\u2019t take her feelings into consideration but the thing is I am home every single day, I work until 6 while also attending classes every day so whenever my girlfriend and I have the same days off we hang out, usually all day and sometimes all night. \n\nThe issue:\n\n   Anyways, since we are both girls we tend to share things such as clothing, makeup (highlighters, eyelash glue, blush, etc) which I don\u2019t mind but recently I found out that when I\u2019m not home and she tends to go into my room without my knowledge and will take my stuff. A lot of the times when I go out of town or stay at a friends or my girlfriends house, I\u2019ll come home and MY stuff is missing and in her room.

The video is only 19 seconds long, and no hard Rs are used.I've a Discord of friends I play World of Warcraft with, a MMORPG game. I'm rather comfortable with my friends, we get along well, and sometimes new friends join our group and our Discord. This conflict was with a relatively new addition to our friend group. Let's call him Jim.\n\nI was up late and I decided to browse my YouTube recommended when I happened upon this video [https://youtu.be/EPObWLXoCpE](https://youtu.be/EPObWLXoCpE) which tickled me. A sort of 'They had us in the first half, not gonna lie' type of video with a good ending. So, thinking this was a funny video, I shared this in our Discord group for others to view and enjoy, and I went back to watching YouTube since I thought no one would be up at 4 AM (we all live in similar timezones afaik).\n\nTo my surprise, I get a message from Jim, informing me that it's not really cool to put that in discord, that he gets it's a joke but that word makes him very uncomfortable.I have seen photos of Jim.Jim is a white-skinned, blonde young man. Just today, he shared with us a partial screenshot of his ancestry results in our Discord that showed him alongside a dark-skinned woman with gorgeous black kinky hair, predicting her to be his 5th-8th cousin.\n\nSomething in my lizard brain decides not to tuck tail and apologise. My lizard brain decides that this was a harmless joke and this fellow white man has some very strong feelings about the N-word, and is about to virtue signal me, educate me, and shame me.So my initial reply was:\"explain to me how is it not okay for me to share a funny video I would get it if I was the one saying it\" (using the n-word myself)\"it's a joke not even a hard rand they bond over it\" (as in they end up in a friendly handshake and a clap on the back, no conflict or anger from either side)\n\nJim tells me that because this word has been used against his family for generations, and he finds it very unsettling to see it being used casually by someone in that sense. Jim tells me that he is not personally against me, and that he had a confrontation with another member of our friend group over using it, and that this isn't a hill worth dying on.\n\nStill not quite understanding, I simply reply with: \"I'm ... not even using it\"  \n\n\n**Edit: accidentally pressed enter. Continuing.**  \n\n\nJim asks me if I understand why it would make a man of carribean heritage uncomfortable.  \n\n\nI say nope, especially not in this context.   \nNow, more context.  \nMy boyfriend is half carribean. His mother was born in Nassau, Bahamas. She had beautiful olive skin before moving to England to marry and have three children. My boyfriend, let's call him Bob, used to be darker when he was a kid, too, but English weather and being inside all the time has drained his colour. He's still darker than me.  \nBob has no problem with the N-word. He does not care what context it is used in unless it is negative. I was afraid of it before, I was afraid of sharing videos of people saying it, sharing written Twitter jokes that had it, until he told me that \"being afraid of it gives the word power, and that power should be taken away from it.\" Mind you, I still don't use it. I never say it, I never write it.   \n\n\nI filtered this information down to Jim, writing:  \n\"My boyfriend is half carribean and he doesn't care about other people using it in a joking sense, i still don't use it around him but i'm used to being able to share videos containing \"the word\" for entertainment reasons, sorry that it upset you\"  \n\n\nGranted, I could have chosen better language for my apology and said 'I'm sorry that -I- upset you,\" but oh well.  \n\n\nJim tells me that \"I feel like you have a very base understanding of this as a white woman, but if this is the hill you want to die on then fine, lol, just count me out of this\"  \n\n\nAnnoyed at this point, I tell him that he invited himself into this, and that I am sorry this cis white woman has a different opinion based on someone who shares his (Jim's) heritage.  \nJim tells me goodnight, and then sends me an article titled 'If you truly knew what the n-word meant to our ancestors, you would NEVER use it' and added: \"I think you'd do well reading this\"  \n\n\nSo, Reddit.

Jim tells me that he is not personally against me, and that he had a confrontation with another member of our friend group over using it, and that this isn&amp;#39;t a hill worth dying on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still not quite understanding, I simply reply with: &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m ... not even using it&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit: accidentally pressed enter. Continuing.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jim asks me if I understand why it would make a man of carribean heritage uncomfortable.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I say nope, especially not in this context.&lt;br/&gt;\nNow, more context.&lt;br/&gt;\nMy boyfriend is half carribean. His mother was born in Nassau, Bahamas. She had beautiful olive skin before moving to England to marry and have three children. My boyfriend, let&amp;#39;s call him Bob, used to be darker when he was a kid, too, but English weather and being inside all the time has drained his colour. He&amp;#39;s still darker than me.&lt;br/&gt;\nBob has no problem with the N-word. He does not care what context it is used in unless it is negative. I was afraid of it before, I was afraid of sharing videos of people saying it, sharing written Twitter jokes that had it, until he told me that &amp;quot;being afraid of it gives the word power, and that power should be taken away from it.&amp;quot; Mind you, I still don&amp;#39;t use it. I never say it, I never write it.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I filtered this information down to Jim, writing:&lt;br/&gt;\n&amp;quot;My boyfriend is half carribean and he doesn&amp;#39;t care about other people using it in a joking sense, i still don&amp;#39;t use it around him but i&amp;#39;m used to being able to share videos containing &amp;quot;the word&amp;quot; for entertainment reasons, sorry that it upset you&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Granted, I could have chosen better language for my apology and said &amp;#39;I&amp;#39;m sorry that -I- upset you,&amp;quot; but oh well.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jim tells me that &amp;quot;I feel like you have a very base understanding of this as a white woman, but if this is the hill you want to die on then fine, lol, just count me out of this&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Annoyed at this point, I tell him that he invited himself into this, and that I am sorry this cis white woman has a different opinion based on someone who shares his (Jim&amp;#39;s) heritage.&lt;br/&gt;\nJim tells me goodnight, and then sends me an article titled &amp;#39;If you truly knew what the n-word meant to our ancestors, you would NEVER use it&amp;#39; and added: &amp;quot;I think you&amp;#39;d do well reading this&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, Reddit. AITA?

So yeah, as the title says, me and my mother have been very distant these past three months, so, the whole year so far. and I think where it started is when i admitted that i wanted to try and live with my dad. Note the word *try.* I decided i should tell her after all the comments I got from my first story, which you can see on my profile i think. She seemed fine with it at first but after a couple more minutes she said that, even though things will seem like a dream at first, it'll get tiring. It took so hard for me to say, \"*Really?? I would've never* fucking *guessed!\"* but ya know, since i didn't want to have a red hand mark on my face i didn't. But I did say that i know, and that i said i wanted to try to live my dad for at least a year, or maybe even less, since i haven't gotten to live with him before. Mostly because she took that away from me. But I didn't say the last part. Read the red hand mark one again. She just shrugged and said fine. and i think things just went downhill from there. over the last two months she's just been so hard, she's just pressuring me over grades so much, it's like she doesn't even accept c's at this point. and i feel like she's just been piling chores and other things to do so much more than usual. All this piled with school work i have almost everyday its like i have no resting time. And if I do get some she finds something to nag me with. I've been getting my grades up, but it's like she doesn't care. I also haven't gone to my therapist in almost two months. So I've just been really agitated.

So yeah, as the title says, me and my mother have been very distant these past three months, so, the whole year so far. and I think where it started is when i admitted that i wanted to try and live with my dad. Note the word &lt;em&gt;try.&lt;/em&gt; I decided i should tell her after all the comments I got from my first story, which you can see on my profile i think. She seemed fine with it at first but after a couple more minutes she said that, even though things will seem like a dream at first, it&amp;#39;ll get tiring. It took so hard for me to say, &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Really?? I would&amp;#39;ve never&lt;/em&gt; fucking &lt;em&gt;guessed!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; but ya know, since i didn&amp;#39;t want to have a red hand mark on my face i didn&amp;#39;t. But I did say that i know, and that i said i wanted to try to live my dad for at least a year, or maybe even less, since i haven&amp;#39;t gotten to live with him before. Mostly because she took that away from me. But I didn&amp;#39;t say the last part. Read the red hand mark one again. She just shrugged and said fine. and i think things just went downhill from there. over the last two months she&amp;#39;s just been so hard, she&amp;#39;s just pressuring me over grades so much, it&amp;#39;s like she doesn&amp;#39;t even accept c&amp;#39;s at this point. and i feel like she&amp;#39;s just been piling chores and other things to do so much more than usual. All this piled with school work i have almost everyday its like i have no resting time. And if I do get some she finds something to nag me with. I&amp;#39;ve been getting my grades up, but it&amp;#39;s like she doesn&amp;#39;t care. I also haven&amp;#39;t gone to my therapist in almost two months. So I&amp;#39;ve just been really agitated. Me and my mom have just been getting into more and more quarrels. and she&amp;#39;s just taken everything but the computer i&amp;#39;m typing on (yet). i haven&amp;#39;t been able to contact anybody for two months.

I understand the importance of work stuff. But he didn&amp;#39;t come after work either. And we had plans to hangout all weekend but he cancelled and said he just wanted to stay home. We barely hung out for the last 2 months because his family was visiting and they didn&amp;#39;t want to meet me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can understand that too, mostly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he never even called me to ask about the hospital or to see if I&amp;#39;m okay. He didn&amp;#39;t call me until the end of the night when I had to ask if he could just call briefly to say good night. He said only if it&amp;#39;s just to say good night and not long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked him to call me today and he ignored my question. I asked again a few hours later after saying he should have called when I had to go to the hospital and he got super annoyed and mad at me for asking over and over to call me (he ignored me the first time so I asked a few hours later).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He never called me all day and he said he would have free time to talk to me more this weekend. He just spent all day watching YouTube videos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He has never come to the hospital when I have gone. And never comes over or calls after.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know he probably doesn&amp;#39;t care about me, and nothing I do will change that. But I love him and don&amp;#39;t want to break up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Am I expecting too much? AITA for asking him to come to the hospital? And asking him to call me more than once when he didn&amp;#39;t come? Am I too needy? Is it normal to not go to the hospital when your partner goes to emergency?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: removed extra words and typos&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2xhvq", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "fivlwr", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ItsRainingFlames", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 11, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": true, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/fivlwr/aita_for_wanting_my_bf_to_come_to_the_hospital/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/fivlwr/aita_for_wanting_my_bf_to_come_to_the_hospital/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1824229, "created_utc": 1584245281.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "AmItheAsshole", "selftext": "Throwaway because I don\u2019t want this private info to get back to me or figured out.

My uncle informed us that he is going to visit and feed his dog and ofc my parents were against it because of the possibility that he'll get infected.

She even uses my religion to dismiss me saying \"if your dumb enough to think there is a God you shouldn't have an opinion on this matter\". So yesterday I clapped back saying if she doesn't like the church she can do that but she shouldn't act harsh towards Christians and I called her a bitch for doing so, she said I was an asshole because it's fair for her act this way due to how the church treated her. Everyone I told about this thought I was horrible for saying that and that she's going through a tough time.
