I ask him how long he think itll be and he still says he doesnt know what hes getting and that he should only be a couple hours. 4 hours go by, the kids are asking where dad is, and I'm wondering too, he says he should be done soon. I put the kids to bed at 7. 9pm rolls around, hes still not done, I ask him what the hell happened to \"a couple hours\" he says, \"he just wants to take it slow and be detailed.\" I say whatever, and go do stuff around the house.

He said he was on his way home, and I was beyond upset by now so I made a comment about how hes said that he was almost done hours ago. So he asked if he should just go to his parents, to which I replied \"if theres a tattoo of a half naked woman on your arm from WoW, then probably\", all he said back was \"theres no boobs\". Like great. He gets home and I just can't deal with it so I go and sleep in my infant daughters room. The next day we go to his parents and as soon as he takes his jacket off, all you can see from the bottom of his sleeve to his elbow is boobs. Like full on cleavage, and that's it. I make a comment and all he has to say is \"there was nothing in the sketch\" like fuck off there was nothing, you have to okay what gets done and if there was nothing there, then the artist added on an extra 4 inches of work unauthorized. I refuse to believe that he did not okay it beforehand. The tattoo is massive and wraps around his entire left shoulder to his elbow. It did not cost only $400 and we don't have any extra savings to afford something like that so I ask where the money came from and he says \"don't worry about it.\" A couple days later, I was doing some bookkeeping and it turns out, he emptied our TFSA to pay for it. We can't afford a ring to get engaged or married, but we sure can afford for him to a half naked woman with perfect boobs that only I can see on his arm.\n\nAm I the asshole for feeling completely shattered over this?"}

Since then, I have been reading up more on social distancing and the potential for every non-symptomatic person to be a carrier and I am starting to think it would be irresponsible and selfish to go at all, even to a different location. I don\u2019t want to go and potential be a carrier. Additionally, I looked up her airline's change policy today and SHE WAS LITERALLY WRONG.

Now me personally, as I've already explained this to him, I found this to be a stupid request seeing as he can easily get a can of monster himself and should get a \"real\" souvenir. To say he got butthurt is an understatement. Dude really got in his feelings over this.\n\nAt some point, as I was easily getting everyone their souvenirs, I then felt guilty over saying no and calling the request stupid. It's kinda like saying no to your child when you originally offered to get them something from the supermarket only to then deny them which leads them to throw a tantrum. You then feel guilty for denying them and wished to make it up to them.\n\nI later offered him the can of monster only to be rudely told no and (worst than a goddamn child) essentially explained to me in a plethora of ways to fuck right off as well as not buy him anything. I even offered to buy him a hat but again was told to fuck right off.\n\nNow the thing is....is that maybe I am the asshole in the situation despite offering him the gift after. I don't know.

I\u2019ll give some examples: X lives in a 3 story house and our son has whole third floor, it\u2019s bigger than my whole apartment. X bought him pinball machines and those are not cheap. X also got him multiple laptops, new iphone as soon as it came out, tv to put in his room in my home, pc, list goes on and on. I\u2019ve talked to X about it and asked him to calm down a bit with the gifts but he says that I don\u2019t get to control what he buys for his son.\n\nHe told me that he wants to get our son a car for his birthday. I\u2019m fine with him buying a normal slightly cheap car, but he wants to buy a car that\u2019s incredibly expensive. I told him that it\u2019s too much. He got upset and repeated the same thing he always says, how I can\u2019t control him. We got in pretty big argument and he\u2019s ignoring me. I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019ll still buy the car."}

She has two kids a 10 and a 9 year old. While I have two kids 14 and a 15 year old that are both in high school. There are 4 bedrooms one me and my wife are using. I figured two keep the 14 and 15 year old room normal and the 10 an 9 year old kid share a bed room. Here is my reasoning my kids are in high school they need to have separate rooms in order to have a peace full quiet place to study as there high school years are important for there futures. I do not think that it would be a good idea to have much noise in the room. Any way. My wife thought that my kids should have bunk beds in there room and change it so her kids can come in and live and she can use the extra room as like a game room etc. I told her no as her kids will distract my kids from studying and that the 9 year old and ten year old kid would have to share the room. AITA\n\nedit - my kids live here full time. My step kids only live in the weekends. My step kids damage and steal property from my kids. My step kids are very loud and distracting to the point my kids can't get any sleep. Also my kids have really good grades and I don't want them to drop"}

A decided b/c of past *private* conversations on religion, I am not invited to social events b/c I will offend religious friends. To be fair to A, I am not a fan of religion and have said some offensive things, but I have been mute on the subject for almost a decade. Apparently it\u2019s an open secret that this is why I'm not invited to social events hosted by A, but I've been polite enough to never discuss it. Instead we usually meet 1-on-1 unless I am hosting an event or organizing an event out in public. I have a diverse friend group and I let people mix when I host things. I trust everyone to be mature adults and get along, I've never had an issue at one of my events.\n\n**Dec:** Had sobering conversation with one friend (Z). The topic of A's exclusionary pattern came up. Z said I should confront A about recent stuff that has happened.\n\n**Jan:** I called A up. We talked for a while, it ended up with yes we're friends... and you're still not going to be invited to things my religious friends are invited to (which is everything my friend hosts \\[birthdays, graduations, holidays, basic celebrations\\]). We will still hang out 1-on-1 and they believe they will still be invited to my events. \n\n**Late Jan:** I told Z about how our conversation ended, they said I'm being a doormat. I don't disagree. I've been weighing throwing out this 10+ year friendship b/c I feel there's a lack of trust/respect and I've bent over backwards for far too long.\n\nBefore I get to that stage, I've floated the idea of banning A from all future events. If A is going to **continue to** hold past comments against me, I won't invite A anymore except for 1-on-1. I have acknowledged A has done bad things/been judgmental about me and other friends. Instead of blowing up the friendship, I chose to turn the other cheek. A holds mistakes against me as paramount, whereas I look at their mistakes as just that, mistakes.\n\n**Ex:** A made insulting remarks against my 3 best friends who we went to HS w/: called X an introverted weirdo, called Y a mega bitch who was going to start drama with them and then has on and off mocked Z's appearance and personality b/c they are more nerdy. I shut all that sh\\*t down but it\u2019s still in the back of my mind whenever they interact. On the contrary, XYZ were excited to reunite w/ A and had no previous prejudice, with that knowledge I didn't ban anyone from my event. In the end it worked itself out. A changed their views of XY b/c they were able to mix and actually get to know each other and A chose to not really interact with Z. A has also screwed up the party vibe w/ drama if we are using their own standards on multiple occasions including one of my landmark birthdays.\n\nMy opinion is that if you won't invite me to any events because you can't trust me to 'behave myself', then I can simply do the same.\n\n**WIBTA for not inviting this friend to future events I host?**"}
